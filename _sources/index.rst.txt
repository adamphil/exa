`Exa Analytics Framework`_
#############################
*An ecosystem for data processing, analytics, and visualization.*

This package provides a framework for building packages tailored to specific
industry or academic applications. Data objects, such as arrays and matrices
are organized into "containers". Containers provide methods for manipulating,
processing, organizing, analyzing, and visualizing their data. The package is
built with minimal external dependencies, on top of established open-source
software, and uses the `Jupyter notebook`_ environment for interactive data
exploration.
